AtomBeat is an implementation of the Atom Publishing Protocol, with a number of extended features including support for versioning, access control and link expansion.

AtomBeat can be used off-the-shelf as a generic content and data server.

AtomBeat also has a plug-in framework which can be used to develop application-specific web services based on the Atom Protocol and following the REST style.
